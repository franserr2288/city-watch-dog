# 🏙️ CivicAction Platform (Public Demo)

This repository contains the **public-facing components** of the CivicAction platform — a modular civic engagement tool designed to empower residents and communities to take informed, localized actions based on data insights.

🚧 **Important Notice:**  
This is a **portfolio version** of the project. Certain core functionalities, including the action-trigger system and automated response mechanisms, are contained in a **private repository** for security reasons. More below.

## 🧩 About the Platform

The CivicAction system is designed to:
- Enable local residents to report, monitor, and engage with civic issues
- Use structured data to prioritize and recommend civic actions

This version is structured for **demo purposes** and highlights architectural intent, UI flow, and key civic module structure.
Because this project deals with civic reporting triggers and could be misused if deployed irresponsibly, I’ve kept the core logic private. What you're seeing is the full UI and architecture, and I’m happy to walk through the rest on request.

## 📁 Included in This Repo

- ✅ User Interface and form components

## 🔒 What’s Not Included

The following components are part of a **private submodule** (`/core`) and are intentionally excluded from this repository to avoid potential misuse:

- ❌ Trigger engine logic (data → action mapping)
- ❌ Action dispatchers (e.g., emailers, notification APIs)
- ❌ Deployment and environment configurations

This separation ensures responsible handling of civic systems and prevents malicious or unintended use.
