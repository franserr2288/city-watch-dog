# ADR-000: Foundational Architecture Principles

## Date

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The CivicAction Platform is being created to empower communities through data, specifically by processing municipal data sources (like 311 service requests) to provide insights and eventually enable automated actions. As I begin this project, I need to establish the fundamental architectural principles that will guide all future design decisions.

Some core challenges I can think of:

1. Working with external data sources with varied formats and availability
2. Need for scalability as I add more data sources and analysis types
3. Requirement for modularity to allow independent development of components
4. Desire for a responsible approach to civic technology that respects privacy and security

## Decision Drivers

- Need to handle diverse municipal data sources
- Desire for maintainable, testable code
- Anticipation of future growth in scope and features
- Importance of separation of concerns for civic technology
- Serverless approach for cost-efficiency and scalability

## Considered Options

- Traditional monolithic MVC architecture
- Microservices architecture with synchronous communication
- Domain-driven design with clean architecture principles
- Event-sourcing and CQRS pattern

## Decision

Going to approach this project structure with DDD in mind, and the following key aspect:

1. **Domain-Centric Organization**: Structure code around business domains rather than technical layers
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between domain logic, application services, and infrastructure
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Use AWS Lambda for compute to enable scaling and reduce operational overhead
4. **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
5. **Explicit Dependencies**: Follow dependency inversion principle
6. **Event-Driven Communication**: Loose coupling between components via events

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear organization that aligns with business domains
- Easier to extend with new capabilities in the future
- Independent deployability of components
- Lower operational costs through serverless approach
- Type safety reduces runtime errors

### Negative

- Higher initial complexity compared to simpler architectures
- Learning curve for developers not familiar with DDD
- Potential for over-engineering if not carefully managed

### Neutral

- Need to establish naming conventions and folder structure
- Regular architecture reviews needed to prevent drift

## Implementation

The initial project structure reflects these principles:

```
src/
├── domains/           # Core business logic
│   ├── analysis/      # Analysis of civic data
│   └── extractors/    # Data extraction from sources
├── entrypoints/       # Application services (Lambda handlers)
├── infrastructure/    # Infrastructure concerns
└── shared/            # Shared utilities
```

Each domain will contain its own models, interfaces, and business logic, isolated from infrastructure concerns.
