# ADR-001: Prototype 311 API Data Ingestion

**Date:** 2025-05-03
**Status:** Proposed

## Context

I need a quick POC for dataflow, system partitioning, and reconning potential test seams before choosing full stack or domain.

## Decision

Use a standalone Python script to fetch 311 data and explore it via pandas.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Financial/budget data:** Too complex for rapid prototyping
- **Other civic APIs:** Similar effort; 311 wins on simplicity
- **JS/TS prototype:** Better for UI later, but slower for raw data work.

## Consequences

- **Positive:**
  - Quick ramp-up in a familiar language
  - Immediate insights into data trends
- **Negative:**
  - Wonâ€™t validate frontend or deployment patterns
  - Requires a follow-on ADR for language or service-layer choices

## Implementation

1. Create python script to call the API and dump JSON
2. Load JSON into pandas DataFrame and export a sample CSV
3. Run simple stats (counts, group-bys) to surface trends
4. Document findings and plan the next ADR
